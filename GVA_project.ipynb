    "#### What is GVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross Value Added (GVA) is a measure of the increase in the value of the economy due to the production of goods and services. It is measured at current basic prices, which include the effect of inflation, excluding taxes (less subsidies) on products (for example, Value Added Tax). GVA plus taxes (less subsidies) on products is equivalent to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional estimates of GVA are measured using the income approach, which involves adding up the income generated by resident individuals or corporations in the production of goods and services.

    "* Table 4: Growth in Gross Value Added (Income Approach)\n",
    "* Table 5: Growth in Gross Value Added (Income Approach) per head of population\n",
    "* Table 6: Gross Value Added (Income Approach) by SIC07 industry at current basic prices\n",
    "* Table 7: Compensation of Employees (CoE) by SIC07 industry at current basic prices\n",
    "* Table 8: Mixed Income by SIC07 industry at current basic prices\n",
    "* Table 9: Rental Income by SIC07 industry at current basic prices\n",
    "* Table 10: Non-Market Capital Consumption by SIC07 industry at current basic prices\n",

    "The goal of the excersise is to analyse how the current basic price for the GVA in Bath and the surrounding area has historically varied, and whether an accurate prediction can be made for future values using a statistical regression.\n",

    "I'm going to use data from table 1 as a target and data from tables 7-15 as explanatory features.\n",
